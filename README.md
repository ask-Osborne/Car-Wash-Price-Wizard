## Functions

### calculate_price

This function takes the car type and a selected service as input and calculates the price for the service. If the car type or service is not found in the pricing dictionary, it returns `None`.

```python
def calculate_price(car_type, service_type):
    try:
        return prices[car_type.lower()][service_type.lower()]
    except KeyError:
        return None  # Handle cases where car_type or service_type is not found.
```

### calculate_total_price
This function calculates the total price for a car based on the selected services. It takes the car type and a list of selected services as input and returns the total price.
If the car type or service is not found in the pricing dictionary, it returns None

```python
def calculate_total_price(car_type, selected_services):
    try:
        total_price = sum(prices[car_type.lower()][service.lower()] for service in selected_services)
        return total_price
    except KeyError:
        return None  # Handle cases where car_type or service_type is not found
```
### calculate_total_price_in_ghs
This function calculates the total price in Ghanaian Cedis (GHS) for a car based on the selected services. It takes the car type and a list of selected services as input and returns the total price in GHS.
If the car type or service is not found in the pricing dictionary, it returns None.
```python
def calculate_total_price_in_ghs(car_type, selected_services):
    try:
        total_price_ghs = sum(prices_ghs[car_type.lower()][service.lower()] for service in selected_services)
        return total_price_ghs
    except KeyError:
        return None  # Handle cases where car_type or service_type is not found
```


calculate_discounted_price
This function calculates the discounted price based on the total price and a discount percentage. It takes the total price and discount percentage as input and returns the discounted price.

```python
def calculate_discounted_price(total_price, discount_percentage):
    discount_amount = (discount_percentage / 100) * total_price
    discounted_price = total_price - discount_amount
    return discounted_price
```

## Reward System

The car pricing model includes a reward system based on the total amount spent on cleaning services. Customers may be eligible for various rewards depending on their total spending:

- If the grand total exceeds $300, the customer wins a fuel coupon.
- If the grand total exceeds $200, the customer wins a pendrive.
- For total spending below $200, no additional rewards are provided.

The reward system is implemented to encourage customer loyalty and provide additional value for choosing our services.
